### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am <a href="https://www.sahiljoshi515.github.io/"> Sahil Joshi </a>

I am a first-year Ph.D. student with a research focus on Large Language Models and their applications. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Prior to starting my Ph.D., I gained two years of industry experience as a Software Engineer at Dell Technologies.

Outside of work, my other interests include travelling to new cities and countries, watching thriller shows, and playing Table Tennis.

I am always open to work on interesting projects and meeting new people to collaborate with. Do checkout my repositories and feel free to message if you feel that I would be a good fit for your projects.
