### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am <a href="https://www.sahiljoshi.com/"> Sahil Joshi </a>

I am double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematical Computing. My key interests include working with IOS Applications, API constructions, Arduino projects and Frontend frameworks. I am deeply interested in Artifical intelligence and Wearable Technology. "Computing for common good" is what I believe in. 

Outside of work, my other interests include travelling to new cities and countries, watching thriller shows, playing Tabla (an Indian classical instrument) and playing Basketball.

I am always open to work on interesting projects and meeting new people to collaborate with. Do checkout my repositories and feel free to message if you feel that I would be a good fit for your preojects.
